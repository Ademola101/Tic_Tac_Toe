## How to Play the Game
- After cloning the repo, the player should run ./bin/ruby main.rb in the terminal.
- Players should enter their names after which they would be assigned roles "X" and "O" to play as respectively. 
- Players will take turns taking up available spots on the board with the aim of getting three Xs or Os in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row and at the same time, still trying to stop the other player from placing three Xs or Os.
- The first player who marks three spots in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
- When all spots on the board are all marked with no successful matches, then, it's a tie.
